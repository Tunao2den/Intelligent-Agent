This project aims to determine the optimal path from an arbitrary initial city to a goal city.

## Map
![Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tunao2den/Intelligent-Agent/main/images/romaniamap.png)

You can check out the path costs from this map.

## Installation
Firstly clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/Tunao2den/kodluyoruzilkrepo.git
```
## Sample Output
```
The number of searched nodes is : 17

The number of generated nodes is : 28

The number of generated nodes in memory is : 8

THE COST PATH IS 80.00.

THE SOLUTION PATH IS:
E5
        action(Go_E5)
E2
        action(Go_E2)
C2
        action(Go_C2)
C1
        action(Go_C1)
A1
