# Intelligent-Agent
This project aims to determine the optimal path from an arbitrary initial city to a goal city.
Before determining the optimal path you can choose the algorithm which you want to use such as:
Breadth-First Search, Uniform-Cost Search, Depth-First Search, Greedy Search, A* Search.

## Map
![Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tunao2den/Intelligent-Agent/main/images/romaniamap.png)

You can check out the path costs from this map.

## Sample Output
The sample output for going Bucharest from Arad by using Greedy search algorithm.
```
The number of searched nodes is : 8

The number of generated nodes is : 9

The number of generated nodes in memory is : 9

THE COST PATH IS 450.00.

THE SOLUTION PATH IS:
Bucharest
        action(Go_Bucharest)
Fagaras
        action(Go_Fagaras)
Sibiu
        action(Go_Sibiu)
Arad

```
